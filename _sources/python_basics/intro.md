# Get started with Python

In this chapter we give some first steps and references for you to quickly learn about python and the software eco-system that will allow you to be productive in computational physics. 

We can recommend [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://nbviewer.org/github/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/master/Index.ipynb) as an excellent way to quickly learn important concepts useful in this course. 



## Setup python on your computer
### Anaconda Python installer

Quick way to install and keep python up to date on your machine

* Anaconda:https://docs.anaconda.com/, 

is an open source
distribution of the Python, Julia and R programming languages for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that simplifies package management and deployment. Package versionsare managed by the package management system _conda_. 


Furthermore, Google's Colab:https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires 
no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. Try it out!

### Useful Python libraries
Here is a list of useful Python libraries 
(if you use anaconda many of these are already there)

* _NumPy_:https://www.numpy.org/ is a highly popular library for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
* _The pandas_:https://pandas.pydata.org/ library provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools 
* _Xarray_:http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/ is a Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!
* _Scipy_:https://www.scipy.org/ (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. 
* _Matplotlib_:https://matplotlib.org/ is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
* _Autograd_:https://github.com/HIPS/autograd can automatically differentiate native Python and Numpy code. It can handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops, ifs, recursion and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives
* _SymPy_:https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. 
* _scikit-learn_:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ has simple and efficient tools for machine learning, data mining and data analysis
* _TensorFlow_:https://www.tensorflow.org/ is a Python library for fast numerical computing created and released by Google
* _Keras_:https://keras.io/ is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano
* And many more such as _pytorch_:https://pytorch.org/,  _Theano_:https://pypi.org/project/Theano/ etc
