# Python Basics

In this chapter we give some first steps and references for you to quickly learn about python and the software eco-system that will allow you to be productive in computational physics. 

We can recommend [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://nbviewer.org/github/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/master/Index.ipynb) as an excellent way to quickly learn important concepts useful in this course.
