# Welcome to Physics 113


Welcome to this collection of the material we cover in Physics 113: Computational Physics here at Stanford. 

````{note} **Class description:** Numerical methods for solving problems in mechanics, astrophysics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics. Methods include numerical integration; solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations; solutions of the diffusion equation, Laplace's equation and Poisson's equation with various methods; statistical methods including Monte Carlo techniques; matrix methods and eigenvalue problems. Short introduction to Python, which is used for class examples and active learning notebooks; independent class projects make up more than half of the grade and may be programmed in any language such as C, Python or Matlab. No Prerequisites but some previous programming experience is advisable.

## Textbooks

_Recommended textbooks_:
- Morten Hjorth-Jensen, *Introduction to Computational Physics*, IoP, in press. The version from 2015 at https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics/blob/master/doc/Lectures/lectures2015.pdf .
- Philipp O.J. Scherer, *Computational Physics, Simulation of Classical and Quantum Systems*, https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319610870 (can be downloaded for free if you are setup with Stanford libraries).
-  Hans Petter Langtangen, *A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python* (2016) ([also available through Springerlink](https://link-springer-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/book/10.1007/978-3-662-49887-3)) focuses more on clean programming and explaining python constructs. 
- The descriptions of algorithms in [Numerical Recipes](http://www.numerical.recipes") (even in their obsolete versions of the books) remains a useful resources to get a quick overview to understand the idea behind certain algorithms.

You will also find a lot of material on "Computational Physics with Python"; online that will be helpful to you.


Some of the materials were taken from [NumFys.net](https://www.numfys.net). 
Using the `jupyter-book` format was inspired by studying the amazing and varied content that [Mike Zingale](https://github.com/zingale) from Stonybrook produces such as his [Computational Astrophysics course](https://zingale.github.io/computational_astrophysics/intro.html).
