# Welcome to Physics 113


Welcome to this collection of the material we cover in Physics 113: Computational Physics here at Stanford. 

````{note} **Class description:** Numerical methods for solving problems in mechanics, astrophysics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics. Methods include numerical integration; solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations; solutions of the diffusion equation, Laplace's equation and Poisson's equation with various methods; statistical methods including Monte Carlo techniques; matrix methods and eigenvalue problems. Short introduction to Python, which is used for class examples and active learning notebooks; independent class projects make up more than half of the grade and may be programmed in any language such as C, Python or Matlab. No Prerequisites but some previous programming experience is advisable.

## Textbooks

_Recommended textbooks_:
- Morten Hjorth-Jensen, *Introduction to Computational Physics*, IoP, in press. The version from 2015 at https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics/blob/master/doc/Lectures/lectures2015.pdf .
- Philipp O.J. Scherer, *Computational Physics, Simulation of Classical and Quantum Systems*, https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319610870 (can be downloaded for free if you are setup with Stanford libraries).
-  Hans Petter Langtangen, *A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python* (2016) ([also available through Springerlink](https://link-springer-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/book/10.1007/978-3-662-49887-3)) focuses more on clean programming and explaining python constructs. 
- The descriptions of algorithms in [Numerical Recipes](http://www.numerical.recipes") (even in their obsolete versions of the books) remains a useful resources to get a quick overview to understand the idea behind certain algorithms.

You will also find a lot of material on "Computational Physics with Python"; online that will be helpful to you.


### Anaconda Python installer

Quick way to install and keep python up to date on your machine

* Anaconda:https://docs.anaconda.com/, 

is an open source
distribution of the Python, Julia and R programming languages for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that simplifies package management and deployment. Package versionsare managed by the package management system _conda_. 


Furthermore, Google's Colab:https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires 
no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. Try it out!

### Useful Python libraries
Here is a list of useful Python libraries 
(if you use anaconda many of these are already there)

* _NumPy_:https://www.numpy.org/ is a highly popular library for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
* _The pandas_:https://pandas.pydata.org/ library provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools 
* _Xarray_:http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/ is a Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!
* _Scipy_:https://www.scipy.org/ (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. 
* _Matplotlib_:https://matplotlib.org/ is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
* _Autograd_:https://github.com/HIPS/autograd can automatically differentiate native Python and Numpy code. It can handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops, ifs, recursion and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives
* _SymPy_:https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. 
* _scikit-learn_:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ has simple and efficient tools for machine learning, data mining and data analysis
* _TensorFlow_:https://www.tensorflow.org/ is a Python library for fast numerical computing created and released by Google
* _Keras_:https://keras.io/ is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano
* And many more such as _pytorch_:https://pytorch.org/,  _Theano_:https://pypi.org/project/Theano/ etc 


Some of the materials were taken from [NumFys.net](https://www.numfys.net). 
Using the `jupyter-book` format was inspired by studying the amazing and varied content that [Mike Zingale](https://github.com/zingale) from Stonybrook produces such as his [Computational Astrophysics course](https://zingale.github.io/computational_astrophysics/intro.html).
